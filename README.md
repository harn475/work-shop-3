# Notes

looking back - this is one of my favourites.
i drew the 'second' image myself, and it certainly was a bigger task than what i should've done.

# Progress (Problem Solving/Code)

this one was fairly straight forward, and as I said I had a lot of fun. if i ran into any issues, i would as my flatmate, or do a quick google. 

**Final coding comments**


# Future development 
maybe make more variations that each cat image can turn into

**Declaration:**

I declare that I received help with my coding from my flatmate, who is experienced with programming. Additionally, I conducted several quick Google searches to resolve issues encountered during the development process. These searches helped in understanding how to implement specific features and troubleshoot problems, especially related to p5.js, as well as getting advice from relevant forums and communities.
